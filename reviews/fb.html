                    <h1>Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore</h1>
                    <h2>The latest Wizarding World movie is better, but will it make a difference?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Thanks to the Crimes of Grindelwald’s misfiring, J.K. Rowling’s extra-acidic views, and Johnny Depp’s legal troubles, 
                        this franchise faces the very real risk of burning out long before completing its planned five-film arc. Whether 
                        Fantastic Beasts crumbles into ash or rises like a phoenix depends almost entirely on its third installment, The 
                        Secrets of Dumbledore.</p>
                    <p>
                        Leave it to Albus to save the day (or at least make a valiant effort). While The Secrets of Dumbledore is miles from 
                        ideal, it at least clears the bar of not leaving a foul, confusing taste like its immediate predecessor.</p>
                    <p>
                        Among its infractions, Crimes of Grindelwald’s gravest was its failure to focus the story on the actual beasts. 
                        Instead, it dwelled on wizard melodrama, ending with villain Gellert Grindelwald’s (then Depp, now Mads Mikkelsen) 
                        shocking reveal that Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) was a member of the Dumbledore family — the brother of Albus 
                        (Jude Law) and son of Aberforth (Richard Coyle), to be exact. That revelation failed to impress audiences, suggesting 
                        that Rowling’s role as sole screenwriter was dragging Fantastic Beasts down.</p>
                    <p>
                        While the Harry Potter author took a backseat role in the original run of movies, she penned the first two Fantastic 
                        Beasts scripts on her own to little critical acclaim. Thankfully, Crimes of Grindelwald finds a solution by bringing 
                        in Steve Kloves, the scribe best known for working on every Harry Potter movie except Order of the Phoenix.</p>

                            <span class="txt-yellow">Nguyên Lê</span> loves films so much he decided 
                            to write about them, despite the fact that English isn’t his first language. 
                            He can cover both the highest profile of titles or those with Asian/Southeast 
                            Asian/Vietnamese elements. Since 2013, Nguyên has written for publications 
                            such as TheScriptLab, InSessionFilm, Houston Chronicle, FANGORIA, AwardsWatch, 
                            /Film and more, or anywhere that wants a fresh perspective on a film. You can 
                            also find him guesting on podcasts such as Action For Everyone, Reel Spoilers, 
                            Cinemania World and more. When not writing, he will be on the search for the next 
                            boba tea spot, recipe to make or an idea to turn into a script.
