                    <h1>The 355</h1>
                    <h2>Star-Studded 355 a Suitably Generic Actioner</h2>
                    <p>
                        The 355 is a passable action programmer that will play fine at home when it’s eventually airing on TBS or TNT 
                        multiple times throughout a weekend. Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o, Penélope Cruz, Diane Kruger, and Bingbing 
                        Fan are a decent team of spies, and director and co-writer Simon Kinberg (X-Men: Dark Phoenix) manages to stage a 
                        couple of well-orchestrated set pieces where things go boom with suitable flair.</p>
                    <p>
                        But none of this is particularly memorable. It may be nicely shot by Tim Maurice-Jones (The Woman in Black) and 
                        efficiently edited by John Gilbert (Adrift) and Lee Smith (1917), and while I was moderately fond of Junkie XL’s 
                        (Mad Max: Fury Road) – aka Tom Holkenborg – energetic score, it’s not like the film goes anywhere unexpected. 
                        There’s not an original bone in this globe-trotting thriller’s body, the whole thing following the James Blond, 
                        Jason Bourne, or Mission: Impossible template so closely, it almost borders on plagiarism.</p>
                    <p>
                        SCIA spies Mace (Chastain) and Nick (Sebastian Stan) are tasked with procuring a powerful electronic device from 
                        a rogue Colombian operative (Edgar Ramírez) who doesn’t know how dangerous this tiny thingamabob actually is. 
                        Events go sideways when German spy Marie (Kruger) arrives on the scenes. They go even more lethally off the rails 
                        when Colombian government therapist Graciela (Cruz) is called in to try and ease tensions.</p>
                    <p>
                        With events spiraling increasingly out of control and with each of their superiors cutting ties with the lot of 
                        them, Mace, Marie, and Graciela realize they must join forces if they are going to survive. They are joined by 
                        former MI6 electronics expert Khadijah (Nyong’o), a friend of Mace’s she coerced out of retirement. Now the four 
                        of them are in a world of hurt, and if they don’t recover the device, each woman is as good as dead.</p>

                            trying to make it as a film critic and freelance entertainment journalist in 
                            the wilds of Washington State. When I'm not watching (and writing about) movies, 
                            I also read (constantly), eat out (mmmmm - mexican food), shop (you can never 
                            have enough shoes), hang out with friends, play softball & basketball, watch 
                            the SuperSonics avidly (even if they do, at the moment, stink) and have far too 
                            unhealthy a fascination with Kelly Clarkson.
