                    <h1>Uncharted</h1>
                    <h2>Uncharted succeeds in spite of its laughably awful script</h2>
                    <p>
                        A film like Uncharted is not really designed to spark broader conversations about the nature of entertainment. 
                        Based on the long-running adventure video game franchise of the same name, it is certainly fair to label the 
                        whole affair as a cash grab designed to appeal to fans of both the series and of superstar lead actor Tom Holland. 
                        There’s something more at stake for the action genre as a whole in this era defined by massive budges and connected 
                        universes.</p>
                    <p>
                        The film is largely a paint-by-number swashbuckler that borrows heavily from 90s genre tropes. Nathan Drake (Holland)
                        is a skilled pickpocket desperate for news of his long-lost brother Sam (Rudy Pankow), the two separated at an 
                        orphanage at an early age. Savvy fortune hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Walhberg) quickly enlists Nathan’s help 
                        in locating the lost treasure of Ferdinand Magellan, both displaying a knowledge of history that highlights their 
                        proficiency at reading half a Wikipedia page.</p>
                    <p>
                        Nathan and Sully are joined in their quest by Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), a fellow thief with an arsenal of one-liners
                        and a weird backstory with Sully. Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a spoiled heir desperate for treasure, and his 
                        chief enforcer Jo (Tati Gabreille) supply the necessary cartoon villainy that every globe-trotting treasure hunt needs. 
                        There are plenty of predictable character twists that anyone can see coming from a mile away, but the actors all showed 
                        up to engage in earnest to bring a semblance of seriousness to their one-dimensional roles.</p>
                    <p>
                        The laughably atrocious screenplay is perpetually buoyed by the film’s tight pacing and strong cast chemistry. Though it 
                        often seems to have happened completely by accident, Uncharted manages to be a pretty entertaining summer action flick. 
                        It’s not good, but it’s too fun to be bad.</p>
