                    <h1>Scream (2022)</h1>
                    <h2>Return to Woodsboro in the latest entry of the beloved “Scream” franchise, now on home video.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Legacy — those who create it rarely live to see it last. Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton has a line in which legacy 
                        is described as “planting seeds in a garden you never get to see grow.” In 1996, master filmmaker Wes Craven 
                        released Scream, a slasher that would literally change the way people spoke about horror films and would rejuvenate 
                        his career. Along with writer Kevin Williamson, he would create and produce four films that took final girl Sidney 
                        Prescott (Neve Campbell) from average teenager potential victim to proactive survivor. Craven passed in August 2015, 
                        but the world he created continues in a new story from directing team Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, known 
                        as the directing duo Radio Silence (Ready or Not), with a script from James Vanderbilt (The Amazing Spider-Man 2) and 
                        Guy Busick (Ready or Not). Having more in common with recently released sci-fi action drama The Matrix Resurrections (2021) 
                        than Halloween (2018), Scream (2022) passes the torch without losing the significance of where the story began: the people 
                        of Woodsboro.</p>
                    <p>
                        Henceforth, when referencing the current film, Scream, it will be present without the date unless necessary. Also, if 
                        you’re interested in a spoiler-free exploration of Scream (2022), then head over to EoM contributor Hunter Heilman’s initial 
                        theatrical review. Going forward, nothing is safe.</p>
                    <p>
                        It’s been more than a decade since Ghostface last appeared in Woodsboro, California, which makes it all the more startling 
                        when Tara Carpenter (Jenna Ortega) ends up in the hospital after managing to escape from the killer’s clutches. This attack 
                        not only puts Sherriff Hicks (Marley Shelton) on high alert, but instigates the return of Tara’s estranged sister 
                        Sam (Melissa Barrera). Seeking an expert, Sam and her boyfriend Richie (Jack Quaid) track down Dewey Riley (David Arquette), 
                        who initially refuses to help, but eventually acquiesces as the past isn’t a thing one can hide from. Sam knows this all too 
                        well herself as, like several of Tara’s friends, she herself has a connection to the 1996 slayings: she’s Billy Loomis’s 
                        (Skeet Ulrich) daughter and it may just be the thing that kills her.

                            <span class="txt-yellow">Douglas Davidson</span> found himself drawn to studying 
                            film in undergrad and graduate school after growing up in a household that loved 
                            watching movies. Though his professional vocations took him in a myriad of directions, 
                            including even all the way to Johns Hopkins University to earn an M.A. in 
                            Communications, he?s always found a way to work his love of cinema into his life. 
                            Douglas eventually created Elements of Madness (EoM) as a means of keeping busy, 
                            but it now serves as a vessel to pour every ounce of geekdom into through reviews of 
                            upcoming releases and a monthly Coming Soon series. In addition to running EoM, he's 
                            co-host of The Cine-Men podcast on the Poprika Podcast Network, a Senior Contributor 
                            Film Critic for Charlotte-based arts and culture blog CLTure, a freelance critic for 
                            the Mountain Xpress, a contributing Film Critic for entertainment website Pretty Vacant 
                            One, and a contributing Film Review Member for online film community FilmFed.
