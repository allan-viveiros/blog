                            Legacy — those who create it rarely live to see it last. <b>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton</b> has a line in which legacy 
                            is described as <em>“planting seeds in a garden you never get to see grow.”</em> In 1996, master filmmaker Wes Craven 
                            released <u>Scream</u>, a slasher that would literally change the way people spoke about horror films and would rejuvenate 
                            his career. Along with writer <b>Kevin Williamson</b>, he would create and produce four films that took final girl <b>Sidney 
                            Prescott</b> <em>(Neve Campbell)</em> from average teenager potential victim to proactive survivor. Craven passed in August 2015, 
                            but the world he created continues in a new story from directing team <b>Matt Bettinelli-Olpin</b> and <b>Tyler Gillett</b>, 
                            known as the directing duo Radio Silence <em>(<u>Ready or Not</u>)</em>, with a script from <b>James Vanderbilt</b> <em>(<u>The 
                            Amazing Spider-Man 2</u>)</em> and <b>Guy Busick</b> <em>(<u>Ready or Not</u>)</em>. Having more in common with recently released 
                            sci-fi action drama <u>The Matrix Resurrections</u> (2021) than <u>Halloween</u> (2018), <b>Scream (2022)</b> passes the torch 
                            without losing the significance of where the story began: <b>the people of Woodsboro</b>.</p>
                        <p>
                            Henceforth, when referencing the current film, <b>Scream</b>, it will be present without the date unless necessary. Also, if 
                            you’re interested in a spoiler-free exploration of <b>Scream (2022)</b>, then head over to EoM contributor Hunter Heilman’s initial 
                            theatrical review. Going forward, nothing is safe.</p>
                        <p>
                            It’s been more than a decade since <b>Ghostface</b> last appeared in <b>Woodsboro</b>, California, which makes it all the more startling 
                            when <b>Tara Carpenter</b> <em>(Jenna Ortega)</em> ends up in the hospital after managing to escape from the killer’s clutches. This attack 
                            not only puts <b>Sherriff Hicks</b> <em>(Marley Shelton)</em> on high alert, but instigates the return of <b>Tara’s estranged</b> sister 
                            <b>Sam</b> <em>(Melissa Barrera)</em>. Seeking an expert, Sam and her boyfriend <b>Richie</b> <em>(Jack Quaid)</em> track down <b>Dewey Riley</b> 
                            <em>(David Arquette)</em>, who initially refuses to help, but eventually acquiesces as the past isn’t a thing one can hide from. <b>Sam</b> 
                            knows this all too well herself as, like several of Tara’s friends, she herself has a connection to the 1996 slayings: she’s <b>Billy Loomis’s</b> 
                            <em>(Skeet Ulrich)</em> daughter and it may just be the thing that kills her.

                            <span class="txt-yellow">Douglas Davidson</span> found himself drawn to studying 
                            film in undergrad and graduate school after growing up in a household that loved 
                            watching movies. Though his professional vocations took him in a myriad of directions, 
                            including even all the way to Johns Hopkins University to earn an M.A. in 
                            Communications, he?s always found a way to work his love of cinema into his life. 
                            Douglas eventually created Elements of Madness (EoM) as a means of keeping busy, 
                            but it now serves as a vessel to pour every ounce of geekdom into through reviews of 
                            upcoming releases and a monthly Coming Soon series. In addition to running EoM, he's 
                            co-host of The Cine-Men podcast on the Poprika Podcast Network, a Senior Contributor 
                            Film Critic for Charlotte-based arts and culture blog CLTure, a freelance critic for 
                            the Mountain Xpress, a contributing Film Critic for entertainment website Pretty Vacant 
                            One, and a contributing Film Review Member for online film community FilmFed.
