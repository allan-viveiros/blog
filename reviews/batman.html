                        <h2>This new take on the Caped Crusader brings together the Bat, the Cat, the Bird, and the Question Mark Guy</h2>

                        <p>
                            <b>The Pitch:</b> No one could say that we currently suffer from a lack of stories about Batman right now. Certainly, 
                            since the character’s original debut in 1939, he’s been a frequent fixture on our screens, with a wide range of 
                            interpretations available to the media consumer going back decades.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Yet, there’s something about a guy who likes dressing up in a cape and Kevlar to pummel bad guys which keeps us watching, 
                            and perhaps that’s why it was inevitable that WarnerMedia would eventually get a new solo Batman adventure into theaters 
                            at some point <em>(despite the ten-year gap between The Dark Knight Rises and this film being filled with <em>Ben Affleck’s</em> 
                            take on the role for <u>Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League</u>)</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, enter <em>Robert Pattinson</em> as a younger, mopier Bruce Wayne, with a penchant for eye black and lurking awkwardly in public 
                            when deprived of the safety of his mask. In the hands of Matt Reeves, who directs and co-wrote the script with Peter Craig, 
                            Bruce Wayne is emo but for a clear reason; a haunted young man focused on his quest to protect Gotham City, at the expense 
                            of literally everything else that might be considered important to the human experience. I Just Wish I Knew How Batman’s 
                            Parents Died.</p>
                        <p>
                            <b>The Verdict:</b> What The Batman does most effectively, almost to the point of dragging down the innate fun of the core premise, 
                            is make it clear that when Bruce Wayne lost his parents, all those years ago, it really fucked him up.
