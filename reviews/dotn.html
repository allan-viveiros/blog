                    <h1>Death on the Nile</h1>
                    <h2>This Agatha Christie remake is a big disappointment says Linda Marric</h2>
                    <p>
                        After a delay of almost two years. Kenneth Branagh’s long-awaited follow up to his Agatha Christie whodunnit Murder 
                        on The Orient Express, is finally here. Reprising his role as famously mustachioed detective Hercule Poirot, director 
                        Branagh heads a stellar cast in this disappointing second adaptation of Christie’s Death on the Nile. The first, 
                        released in 1978, starred the late Peter Ustinov as the famous detective.</p>
                    <p>
                        Screenwriter Michael Green also returns in this star-studded murder mystery which features turns from Gal Gadot 
                        (Wonder Woman), Armie Hammer (Call Me By Your Name), Sophie Okonedo (Dirty Pretty Things, Wild Rose), Annette Bening, 
                        Tom Bateman and many more.</p>
                    <p>
                        The story takes place in 1937. After a whirlwind romance in London, socialite Linnet Ridgeway (Gadot) and handsome 
                        lothario Simon Doyle (Hammer) invite a group of their friends and family to celebrate their honeymoon on board a 
                        plush river steamer on the Nile. Poirot’s own Egyptian holiday is suddenly derailed by the newlyweds who beg the 
                        Belgian sleuth to help protect them from Simon’s jealous ex fiancée Jacqueline de Bellefort (Emma Mackey), who 
                        also happens to be one of Linnet’s oldest friends. As things would have it, disaster strikes onboard, leaving it 
                        to Poirot to solve yet another murder mystery.

                            <span class="txt-yellow">Linda Marric</span> is a freelance film critic 
                            and interviewer. She has written extensively about film and TV over the 
                            last decade. After graduating with a degree in Film Studies from King's 
                            College London, she has worked in post-production on a number of film 
                            projects and other film-related roles. She has a huge passion for 
                            intelligent sci-fi movies and is never put off by the prospect of a 
                            romantic comedy. Her favourite movie is Brazil.
